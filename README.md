## Project background
The system is designed to automate data collection. It can be configured to search for keywords, rank and screen based on data from the film site. Implemented to generate recommendations based on user preferences by analysing search data and browsing history.
## Project content
Design a program framework and implement the following functions:
**-1-** Initialize the UI framework and load the interface elements.
**-2-** Construct requests based on keywords and parse the returned data.
**-3-** Construct requests based on filtering conditions and parse the ranking interface data.
**-4-** Implement local storage for the parsed image and text data.
## Project highlights
**-1-** The project applies multi-threading technology to enable asynchronous execution of multiple keyword queries.
**-2-** The UI interface can be extended with frames to support parallel processing of keyword search and ranking selection.
**-3-** A multimodal interface is implemented, displaying text and images, and clicking a button can view movie details and resource URLs.
