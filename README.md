# python_spider_douban
## Project background
Python spider technology can be used to automatically collect data. This project is based on tools and third-party libraries to achieve keyword search, ranking selection, and other functions for Douban movie data.
## Project content
Design a program framework and implement the following functions:
**-1-**Initialize the UI framework and load the interface elements.
**-2-**Construct requests based on keywords and parse the returned data.
**-3-**Construct requests based on filtering conditions and parse the ranking interface data.
**-4-**Implement local storage for the parsed image and text data.
## Project highlights
**-1-**The project applies multi-threading technology to enable asynchronous execution of multiple keyword queries.
**-2-**The UI interface can be extended with frames to support parallel processing of keyword search and ranking selection.
**-3-**A multimodal interface is implemented, displaying text and images, and clicking a button can view movie details and resource URLs.
